--Description:
The Cyber Security Incident Analysis and Response project is an advanced system designed to proactively detect and respond to cyber threats within an organization's network. Leveraging the "UNSW-NB15" dataset and SQL, this project provides an in-depth analysis of network log data to identify potential security breaches and quickly respond to incidents, ensuring data integrity and network resilience.

--Key Highlights:
1. Data-driven Cyber Security: The project utilizes SQL queries to manipulate and analyze network log data, offering valuable insights into attack patterns, intrusion attempts, and probing activities. With real-time monitoring and automated alerting, it enables swift response to potential threats.

2. Advanced SQL Techniques: Employing complex SQL queries, the system performs conditional aggregations, subqueries, and filtering to extract meaningful information. From calculating average payload sizes to analyzing SYN/ACK flags, the project delves deep into cyber security analytics.

3. Improved Incident Response: The project's actionable insights empower cyber security professionals to optimize incident response strategies, detect anomalies, and swiftly mitigate attacks. Its interactive visualizations facilitate data-driven decision-making for enhanced network protection.

--SQL Code:

1. What are the top 5 source IP addresses involved in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and for each source IP, what is the average duration of their attack flows?

SELECT srcip, AVG(duration) AS avg_attack_duration
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat = 'DoS' AND duration > 0
GROUP BY srcip
ORDER BY avg_attack_duration DESC
LIMIT 5;

2. For each type of intrusion attempt, what is the average number of packets per flow and the average payload size in bytes?

SELECT attack_cat,
       AVG(pkts) AS avg_packets_per_flow,
       AVG(totallen) AS avg_payload_size_bytes
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat LIKE 'Intrusion%'
GROUP BY attack_cat;

3. Among the top 10 most frequent source IP addresses involved in DoS attacks, what percentage of their flows have a "FIN" flag set in their TCP flags?

SELECT srcip,
       (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM unsw_nb15 WHERE attack_cat = 'DoS' AND srcip IN (SELECT srcip FROM unsw_nb15 WHERE attack_cat = 'DoS' GROUP BY srcip ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 10))) AS fin_flag_percentage
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat = 'DoS' AND tcp_flags LIKE '%F%'
GROUP BY srcip;

4. Calculate the average number of packets per flow for attack categories that have an average payload size greater than 500 bytes.

SELECT attack_cat, AVG(pkts) AS avg_packets_per_flow
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat IN (SELECT attack_cat FROM unsw_nb15 GROUP BY attack_cat HAVING AVG(totallen) > 500)
GROUP BY attack_cat;

5. For each type of attack, calculate the median time-to-live (TTL) value of flows that have a payload size larger than the average payload size for that attack type.

SELECT attack_cat, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ttl) AS median_ttl
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat IS NOT NULL AND totallen > (SELECT AVG(totallen) FROM unsw_nb15 WHERE attack_cat = a.attack_cat GROUP BY attack_cat) 
GROUP BY attack_cat;

6. Identify the top 3 destination IP addresses that have the highest average payload size and the highest number of packets per flow among all attack categories.

SELECT dstip, AVG(totallen) AS avg_payload_size, AVG(pkts) AS avg_packets_per_flow
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY dstip
ORDER BY avg_payload_size DESC, avg_packets_per_flow DESC
LIMIT 3;

7. Calculate the percentage of flows with "SYN" flag set in their TCP flags for each attack category, considering only flows with a duration longer than 5 seconds.

SELECT attack_cat, (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM unsw_nb15 WHERE attack_cat IS NOT NULL AND duration > 5)) AS syn_flag_percentage
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat IS NOT NULL AND duration > 5 AND tcp_flags LIKE '%S%'
GROUP BY attack_cat;

8. For each type of intrusion attempt, calculate the percentage of flows that have both the "SYN" and "ACK" flags set in their TCP flags.

SELECT attack_cat, (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM unsw_nb15 WHERE attack_cat LIKE 'Intrusion%')) AS syn_ack_percentage
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE attack_cat LIKE 'Intrusion%' AND tcp_flags LIKE '%SA%'
GROUP BY attack_cat;

9. Find the average number of packets per flow for flows with "FIN" flag set in their TCP flags, grouped by each attack category, and sort the results in descending order.

SELECT attack_cat, AVG(pkts) AS avg_packets_per_flow
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE tcp_flags LIKE '%F%'
GROUP BY attack_cat
ORDER BY avg_packets_per_flow DESC;

10. Calculate the average payload size for each source and destination IP pair that has more than 10 flows in the dataset.

SELECT srcip, dstip, AVG(totallen) AS avg_payload_size
FROM unsw_nb15
WHERE (srcip, dstip) IN (SELECT srcip, dstip FROM unsw_nb15 GROUP BY srcip, dstip HAVING COUNT(*) > 10)
GROUP BY srcip, dstip;
